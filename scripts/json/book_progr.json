Most approaches to this problem enhance the complexity of the vehicle system by adding components such as electrical motors or storage devices. Such a complex system can only be designed by means of mathematical models. This text gives an introduction to the modeling and optimization problems typically encountered when designing new propulsion systems for passenger cars. It is intended for persons interested in the analysis and optimization of classical and novel vehicle propulsion systems. Its focus lies on the control-oriented mathematical description of the physical processes and on the model-based optimization of the system structure and of the supervisory control algorithms. This text has evolved from a lecture series at ETH Zurich. Prerequisites are general engineering topics and a first course in optimal control theory.",

Although the details of biological evolution are not completely understood (even nowadays), there exist some points supported by strong experimental evidence: \u2022 Evolution is a process operating over chromosomes rather than over organisms. The former are organic tools encoding the structure of a living being, i.e., a cr- ture is \u201cbuilt\u201d decoding a set of chromosomes. \u2022 Natural selection is the mechanism that relates chromosomes with the ef ciency of the entity they represent, thus allowing that ef cient organism which is we- adapted to the environment to reproduce more often than those which are not. \u2022 The evolutionary process takes place during the reproduction stage. There exists a large number of reproductive mechanisms in Nature. Most common ones are mutation (that causes the chromosomes of offspring to be different to those of the parents) and recombination (that combines the chromosomes of the parents to produce the offspring). Based upon the features above, the three mentioned models of evolutionary c- puting were independently (and almost simultaneously) developed.",

        "description": "In this book, the self-healing of composite structures with shape memory polymer as either matrix or embedded suture is systematically discussed. Self-healing has been well known in biological systems for many years: a typical example is the self-healing of human skin. Whilst a minor wound can be self-closed by blood clotting, a deep and wide cut needs external help by suturing. Inspired by this observation, this book proposes a two-step close-then-heal (CTH) scheme for healing wide-opened cracks in composite structures\u2013by constrained shape recovery first, followed by molecular healing. It is demonstrated that the CTH scheme can heal wide-opened structural cracks repeatedly, efficiently, timely, and molecularly. It is believed that self-healing represents the next-generation technology and will become an engineering reality in the near future. The book consists of both fundamental background and practical skills for implementing the CTH scheme, with additional focus on understanding strain memory versus stress memory and healing efficiency evaluation under various fracture modes. Potential applications to civil engineering structures, including sealant for bridge decks and concrete pavements, and rutting resistant asphalt pavements, are also explored. This book will help readers to understand this emerging field, and to establish a framework for new innovation in this direction. Key features: explores potential applications of shape memory polymers in civil engineering structures, which is believed to be unique within the literature balanced testing and mathematical modeling, useful for both academic researchers and practitioners the self-healing scheme is based on physical change of polymers and is written in an easy to understand style for engineering professionals without a strong background in chemistry",

Presenting the distinguished and exemplary works by educators and researchers in the field highlighting the contemporary trends and issues, creative and unique approaches, innovative methods, frameworks, pedagogies and theoretical and practical aspects in computational thinking. A decade ago the notion of computational thinking was introduced by Jeannette Wing and envisioned that computational thinking will be a fundamental skill that complements to reading, writing and arithmetic for everyone and represents a universally applicable attitude. The computational thinking is considered a thought processes involved in a way of solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behaviour. Assimilating computational thinking at young age will assist them to enhance problem solving skills, improve logical reasoning, and advance analytical ability - key attributes to succeed in the 21st century. Educators around the world are investing their relentless effort in equipping the young generation with real-world skills ready for the demand and challenges of the future. It is commonly believed that computational thinking will play a pivotal and dominant role in this endeavour. Wide-ranging research on and application of computational thinking in education have been emerged in the last ten years. This book will document attempts to conduct systematic, prodigious and multidisciplinary research in computational thinking and present their findings and accomplishments.",

It aims to use mathematical theory of programming to provide a similar basis for specification, design and implementation of programs. It is wide ranging both in its subject matter and also in its approach and style. The first five chapters justify and introduce the main concepts and methods to be used within the text, relating the goal of unification to the achievements of other branches of science and mathematics. The remaining chapters introduce more advanced programming language features one by one. The main methods of programming are summarised and concluded in a manner suitable for those already familiar with programming semantics. Definitions are accompanied by examples and the theorems by meticulous proof.",

Furthermore, the proof rules can be used to derive a correct program from a specification as well as to verify that a given program has a certain property.

In 2014, the author, Wolfgang Loder, developed a repository for digital assets that had to deliver those assets in binary form quickly and reliably, being able to deal with at least hundreds of requests per second. Since he could decide the architecture and software stack of the solution, he immediately thought of Erlang and its libraries and started to evaluate this option. It was not long after that he discovered Elixir, which sits on top of the Erlang virtual machine and has features more palatable for non-functional programmers, although it is a functional programming language itself. Erlang and Elixir for Imperative Programmers gives you a basis for deciding whether the effort is viable for your next project. This book is partly a tale of the author's own experience and partly a description of the bigger and more subtle differences between Erlang/Elixir and languages such as C++, Java, and C#. What You'll Learn Discover functional programming, Erlang, and Elixir Work on service design and service features Set up your environment: deployment, development, and production Implement the service including public interface, asset processing, and deployment Use the patterns and concepts found in Erlang including type creation concepts and code structuring. Who This Book Is For Experienced and savvy programmers, coders, and developers new to Erlang and Elixir.",

They range from very specialized tools that do one particular task, to generalized suites that do just about everything except replace bad Ethernet cables. Even better, many of them are absolutely free. There's only one problem: who has time to track them all down, sort through them for the best ones for a particular purpose, or figure out how to use them? Network Troubleshooting Tools does the work for you--by describing the best of the freely available tools for debugging and troubleshooting. You can start with a lesser-known version of ping that diagnoses connectivity problems, or take on a much more comprehensive program like MRTG for graphing traffic through network interfaces. There's tkined for mapping and automatically monitoring networks, and Ethereal for capturing packets and debugging low-level problems. This book isn't just about the tools available for troubleshooting common network problems. It also outlines a systematic approach to network troubleshooting: how to document your network so you know how it behaves under normal conditions, and how to think about problems when they arise, so you can solve them more effectively. The topics covered in this book include: Understanding your network Connectivity testing Evaluating the path between two network nodes Tools for capturing packets Tools for network discovery and mapping Tools for working with SNMP Performance monitoring Testing application layer protocols Software sources If you're involved with network operations, this book will save you time, money, and needless experimentation.",

Covers thoroughly the VSAM key sequenced data set knowledge and techniques needed to operate productively in the business data processing environment. Illustrates tools in documented source code form -- computational CLISTs, programs that read LISTCATs and automatically extract and analyze them, and prime or alternate key value distribution analysis routines (diskette available for uploading to mainframe). Also addresses management of VSAM data sets in the production environment.",

Fixed Income Mathematics begins with basic concepts of the mathematics of finance, then systematically builds on them to reveal state-of-the-art methodologies for evaluating them and managing fixed-income portfolios. Concepts are illustrated with numerical examples and graphs, and you need only a basic knowledge of elementary algebra to understand them. This new edition includes several entirely new chapters\u2015Risk-Adjusted Returns, Empirical Duration, Analysis of Floating-Rate Securities, Holdings-Based Return Attribution Analysis, Returns-Based Style Attribution Analysis, Measuring Bond Liquidity, and Machine Learning\u2015and provides substantially revised chapters on: Interest rate modeling Probability theory Optimization models and applications to bond portfolio management Historical return measures Measuring historical return volatility The concepts and methodologies for managing fixed income portfolios has improved dramatically over the past 15 years. This edition explains these changes and provides the knowledge you need to value fixed-income securities and measure the various types of risks associated with individual securities and portfolios.",

Sunstein examines broadcasting, campaign finance, hate speech, pornography, government art funding, commercial speech, and the privacy of rape victims.

If the government, say were to use broadcasting markets to encourage attention to public issues and diverse points of view, the First Amendment would not stand in the way.

        "description": "The future of computing ever-increasingly lies in ever-increasing mobility in which computers continue their network operations while physically changing their location, and code moves from system to system performing its designated tasks throughout a network. This book brings together in one single resource the leading edge of research and practice in three areas of mobility: process migration, mobile computing, and mobile agents. Presented chronologically, the papers in this book--each written by leading experts in that particular area--track the development of critical technologies that have influenced mobility. Introductions by the editors and original afterwords by many of the papers' authors provide information on implementation and practical application, technological context, and updates on the most recent advances. The book highlights many common challenges and solutions inherent in various aspects of mobility: infrastructure, scalability, security, standards, robustness, naming and locating mobile entities, and more. Individual papers describe specific research and development in each of the three major areas, covering such topics as: An analysis of process migration from the earliest work to contemporary commercial systems Barriers to effective mobile connectivity, mobile IP, and ubiquitous computing Descriptions of various mobile agent systems, such as Telescript, Aglets, Agent TCL, and the mobile agent system standard (MASIF) This selection of influential papers illustrates the evolution of mobile technology as well as the state of the art of one of the most significant trends in computing. 0201379287B04062001",

The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.\u201d \u2014 Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change \u201cI found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!\u201d \u2014 Martin Fowler, author of Refactoring and UML Distilled \u201cI would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.\u201d \u2014 Kevin Ruland, Management Science, MSG-Logistics \u201cThe wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies\u2014tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.\u201d \u2014 John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design \u201cThis is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.\u201d \u2014 Eric Vought, Software Engineer \u201cMost modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.\u201d \u2014 Pete McBreen, Independent Consultant \u201cSince reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker! This should be a desktop reference for everyone who works with code for a living.\u201d \u2014 Jared Richardson, Senior Software Developer, iRenaissance, Inc. \u201cI would like to see this issued to every new employee at my company....\u201d \u2014 Chris Cleeland, Senior Software Engineer, Object Computing, Inc. \u201cIf I\u2019m putting together a project, it\u2019s the authors of this book that I want. . . . And failing that I\u2019d settle for people who\u2019ve read their book.\u201d \u2014 Ward Cunningham Straight from the programming trenches, The Pragmatic Programmer cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process--taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you'll learn how to Fight software rot; Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; Write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; Avoid programming by coincidence; Bullet-proof your code with contracts, assertions, and exceptions; Capture real requirements; Test ruthlessly and effectively; Delight your users; Build teams of pragmatic programmers; and Make your developments more precise with automation. Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you're a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you'll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. You'll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career. You'll become a Pragmatic Programmer.",

        "description": "Are You Ready To Learn C Programming Easily? This book is also designed for software programmers who want to learn the C programming language from scratch. It provides you with an adequate understanding of the programming language. From there, you can bring yourself towards a higher level of expertise. While you are not really required to have any previous experience with computer programming, you still need to have a basic understanding of the terms commonly used in programming and computers. You see, the C language is one of the most recommended computer programming languages for beginners. After all, it is a predecessor to many of the modern programming languages used today, such as Java and Python. In other words, before you can effectively learn these languages, you have to have a clear understanding of the C language first. Through this book, you will learn how to write your first programs and see how they work in real time. You have to keep in mind that it is perfectly okay to make mistakes every now and then. It is through these mistakes that you learn. So, when you encounter an error on your program, you just have to study the part where you went wrong and redo it. When you run the programs in the C language, you will be notified in case you made a mistake. You will see the error and know which line you have to modify. This book also teaches you how you can write the shortest programs possible, without negatively affecting your output. As a programmer, you want to make the most of your available time and space while still being efficient. You will also learn how to organise your codes and include remarks via comments so that you and your readers will not get confused.

C++ is an object orientated computer language created by remarkable computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as a part of the evolution of the C family of languages. A few call C++ \"C with Classes\" because it introduces object orientated programming principles, including using defined classes, to C program language period framework. C++ is stated \"see-plus-plus.\" In object orientated programming, an object is a facts kind that has each records and capabilities inherent in its design. Previous to the arrival of object orientated programming, programmers or users usually noticed a codebase as composed of individual command line commands. The identity of objects with functions and data constructed in brought about a brand-new way of packaging and automating code work. For a tremendous example of item orientated programming in C++, one of the most notable and beneficial capabilities of the language changed into the C++ stack. The C++ stack is a class in C++ that has the following characteristics it's miles a virtual last in first out sequential storage field that has a defined set of elements. The functions 'push' and 'pop' both push a new object/item into the bottom of the stack or pop the first to be had item from the top of the stack. Programmers have utilized the C++ stack in lots of distinct ways to obtain desired output concerning variable assessment and practical operations inside a codebase. The language also applies principles of encapsulation, which identifies usage models, and inheritance, where one class can inherit certain attributes. Another way to examine C++ in a practical sense is to begin enumerating special forms of mistakes that occur as the written code makes its way to final execution. Buy it Now and let your customers get addicted to this amazing book!",

        "description": "Description Inside, you will find an introduction to JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. These are computer programming languages. Some of them are more precisely referred to as scripting languages. Starting with JavaScript, I will introduce you to the above-mentioned programming languages. Hopefully, by the end of this book, you will have the answers to the questions of what it is and what you can do with it. JavaScript is a programming language that allows for the implementation of complex items on static web pages. Every time you look at a web page that does something besides display static information, it is a pretty safe assumption to make that JavaScript is involved. It is often referred to as the third layer of the cake. HTML is a relatively simple programming language that, at its core, consists of elements. These elements allow you to distinguish different sections of text as different aspects on your page. Whether it be a paragraph, a heading, a column, or whatever you need it to be--this is accomplished with the use of these elements. This language is also where you get the ability to create hyperlinks. The use of hyperlinks is very important, especially when you want to be able to direct someone to a specific part of your text or page. CSS is a programming language that is used to style and structure the layout of a web page. If you want to change your font, color, and background, you may do so by adding an animation or design a specific outline. This is the language you're going to make use of to accomplish those things. CSS makes use of the box model--most elements are represented as a box with the content, padding, and borders built-up like layers on an onion. You need to understand the box model before you can begin to understand how to create CSS layouts. Meanwhile, SQL is a programming language that is designed to work with sets of facts and how they relate to each other. As you might expect, relational database programs make use of SQL. Like many other computer languages, SQL is, in fact, an international standard. However, SQL is easily read and understood even by beginners. Data sets are described in SQL using SELECT statements. An SQL statement is like a sentence and consists of clauses. Some clauses are required in a SELECT statement.",

Ullmann provides a computer-free introduction to data processing; imparts skill in relational algebra, normalized file design, and design of access-path data structures, by means of copious examples and exercises; and gives full accounts of file organization and database administration. Students of computer science at many levels will find this book a useful bridge between standard PASCAL programming and the latest developments in database technology.",

        "description": "The popular C# programming language combines the high productivity of rapid application development languages with the raw power of C and C++. Updated to cover the new features of C# 4.0, including dynamic binding, named and optional parameters, and covariant and contravariant generic types, this release takes the language to the next level by adding the ability to cleanly write programs that don\u2019t rely on static type definitions. This allows dynamic programming languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript to feel native to C#. The C# Programming Language, Fourth Edition, continues to be the authoritative and annotated technical reference for C# 4.0. 7nbsp; Written by Anders Hejlsberg, the language\u2019s architect, and his colleagues, Mads Torgersen, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde, this volume has been completely updated for C# 4.0. The book provides the complete specification of the language, along with descriptions, reference materials, code samples, and annotations from twelve prominent C# gurus. The many annotations bring a depth and breadth of understanding rarely found in any programming book. As the main text of the book introduces the concepts of the C# language, cogent annotations explain why they are important, how they are used, how they relate to other languages, and even how they evolved. This book is the definitive, must-have reference for any developer who wants to understand C#. With annotations from: Brad Abrams, Joseph Albahari, Krzysztof Cwalina, Jesse Liberty, Eric Lippert, Christian Nagel, Vladimir Reshetnikov, Marek Safar, Chris Sells, Peter Sestoft, Jon Skeet, and Bill Wagner.",

Based on the ubiquitous Java, it provides an alternative to daunting languages and expensive proprietary software. This book gives graphic designers, artists and illustrators of all stripes a jump start to working with processing by providing detailed information on the basic principles of programming with the language, followed by careful, step-by-step explanations of select advanced techniques.The author teaches computer graphics at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, and his book has been developed with a supportive learning experience at its core. From algorithms and data mining to rendering and debugging, it teaches object-oriented programming from the ground up within the fascinating context of interactive visual media.Previously announced as \"Pixels, Patterns, and Processing\" - A guided journey from the very basics of computer programming through to creating custom interactive 3D graphics - Step-by-step examples, approachable language, exercises, and LOTS of sample code support the reader's learning curve - Includes lessons on how to program live video, animated images and interactive sound",

Program listings often do not work until you have mucked around using trial and error. I like to use books as reference after I have read them. Invariably, none of the books have the particular information that I want, nor do they have references to other information sources. \u201cJava Programming -- What Do You Want To Do?\u201d changes all that. Inside there are clear instructions on how to do what you want to do -- Basic structures, graphics programming with AWT and NetBeans, Advanced structures, test preparation, networking, cell phone programming and much more.",

Like the best-selling Think Like a Programmer before it (with over 75,000 copies sold worldwide), this Python-based edition will help you transition from reading programs to writing them, in, Python. (No prior programming experience required!) Rather than simply point out solutions to problems, author V. Anton Spraul will get you thinking by exposing you to techniques that will teach you how to solve programming problems on your own. Each chapter covers a single programming concept like data types, control flow, code reuse, recursion, and classes, then a series of Python-based exercises have you put your skills to the test. You\u2019ll learn how to: -Break big problems down into simple, manageable steps to build into solutions -Write custom functions to solve new problems -Use a debugger to examine each line of your running program in order to fully understand how it works -Tackle problems strategically by turning each new concept into a problem-solving tool The Python edition of Think Like a Programmer aims squarely at the beginning programmer, with additional chapters on early programming topics such as variables, decisions, and looping. Version: This book is based on Python 3.",
